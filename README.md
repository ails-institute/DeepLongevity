# DeepLogevity
Deep Learning for ageing analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans micrographs.

Here we compare several deep learning approaches in dedecting lifespan and movement of C. elegans worms. Using this approach we are looking for label-free microgrphs cues allowing us to study logevity of these organisms.
