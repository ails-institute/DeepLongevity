Deep Learning for ageing analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans micrographs.

Here we compare several deep learning approaches in predicing lifespan and total movement of C. elegans worms. Using this approach we are looking for label-free micrographs cues allowing us to locate age-related pathologies in the model organism.
